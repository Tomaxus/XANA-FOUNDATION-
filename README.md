# Project: Football & Literature

A curated digital space exploring the intersection of the "beautiful game" and the world of letters. This project delves into how football transcends the pitch to become a narrative force in essays, poetry, and fiction.

## ⚽ About the Project
This project is dedicated to the cultural and artistic side of football. Rather than focusing on scores and statistics, we explore the **emotions, myths, and social impacts** of the sport through a literary lens.

## 📚 Key Features
* **Literary Analysis:** Exploring works by authors who wrote about football (e.g., Eduardo Galeano, Nick Hornby, Albert Camus).
* **Creative Writing:** Original narratives and essays inspired by iconic matches and players.
* **Cultural History:** Examining how football serves as a "universal language" in global literature.
* **The "Ninth Art":** A look at the aesthetics of the game as a form of performance art.
